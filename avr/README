This is a non-recursive make build system that supports large and deeply nested
source trees. Adding sub directories to the build is trivial and requires a
minimal make file. With a mindful layout of the source files, make is able to be
run from any sub directory within the source tree and the build system will only
compile the sources found in and below the current working directory.

The build system also has verbosity control on the build. Add "V=1" to the
make command to get a full output of the commands being called to build.

There are a few potential drawbacks such as not being able to have different
files in the source tree with the same name.

***AVR - ATmega

AVR support has been added. In order to configure support for AVR uncomment the
include avr.mk in the common.mk file. Ensure that all variables in avr.mk are
set properly for your system.

To specify an AVR compiled file the target name should have a '.hex' extension.
All targets with a '.hex' extension will also have a rule called 'up-*.hex' that
uses avrdude to upload to the chip. For instance, for a target named blink.hex a
rule will also exist for up-blink.hex and calling 'make up-blink.hex' will
result in blink.hex being compiled and the hex file being uploaded using the
AVRDUDE_* variables in the avr.mk file.
